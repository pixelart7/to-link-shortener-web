# to-link-shortener-web
This is an educational project for me to learn to learn the AMP framework with CSS animations built using [Surge](https://surge.sh/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [KVdb](https://kvdb.io/).

It is a primary repository for this project, and it is meant to deploy on Netlify because it use Netlify Functions. Of course, it is possible to modify it and change it to a standalone server.

The companion repository is also accessible via [Github](https://github.com/pixelart7/to-link-shortener-surge-sh).

**IMPORTANT:** This service is not suitable to use in production as KVdb allows people to replace created key.
